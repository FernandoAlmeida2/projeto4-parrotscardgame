# Project 04: Parrots Card Game

This project is an implementation of a memory card game. The player chooses a number of cards (min: 2 pairs; max: 7 pairs), and the cards are distributed ramdomly on the board. The rules are the same as any other memory card game. There is a second timer displayed at the top right corner and a "resign the game" button in the bottom right corner of the screen. When the player wins the game, a prompt is displayed to show the number of moves and the time spent (in seconds) in the game. Then, a new prompt asks if the player wants to play again; if so, the initial prompt is displayed asking for the number of cards again.

It's a project for bootcamp training, so the purpose is exclusively for learning and gaining experience. The most challenging for me was to make the cards flip and the timer implementation, mostly because of my lack of knowledge about the functions to solve the main problems with it.
