# Project 04: Parrots Card Game

This project is a implementation of a memeory card game. The player chooses a number of cards (min: 2 pairs; max: 7 pairs), and the cards are distributed ramdomly
in the board. The rules are the same as any memory card game. There is a seconds timer watch at the top right corner and a "resign the game" button in
the bottom right corner of the screen. When the player wins the game, a prompt are displayed to show the number of moves and the time spent (in seconds) in the game.
Then, a new prompt asks if the player wants to play again: if yes, the initial prompt are displayed asking the number of cards again.
    
It's a project for a bootcamp training, so the purpose is exclusively for learning and gaining experience. The most challenging for me was to make the cards flipping, and
the timer implementation, most because of my lack of knowledge about the functions to solve the main problems to it.
